Typescript-gmap-api-implimentation

This is an application I made for learning purpose.I have implimented Google map with typescript,It shows the user location and company location.I am following Stephen Grider tutorial.

<b>What I used:</b>
<h4>Faker for data resource [Install cmd: "npm install faker" and for type Defination "npm install @types/faker"].</h4>
<h4>Google map api to impliment the user and company location [For google type defination "npm install @types/googlemaps"].</h4>
<h4>I used parcel as a server.</h4>

<h4>Caution:</h4>
<h4>You may face difficulties while getting the API key from google it may ask you for billing information.</h4>
