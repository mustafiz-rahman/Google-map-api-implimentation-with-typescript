Typescript-gmap-api-implimentation

This is an application I made for learning purpose.I have implimented Google map with typescript,It shows the user location and company location.I am following Stephen Grider tutorial.

What I used:
Faker for data resource [Install cmd: "npm install faker" and for type Defination "npm install @types/faker"].
Google map api to impliment the user and company location [For google type defination "npm install @types/googlemaps"]
I used parcel as a server.

Caution:
You may face difficulties while getting the API key from google it may ask you for billing information.
